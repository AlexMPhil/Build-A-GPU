# Build-A-GPU
Aiming to build a simple 2D GPU and implement it on an FPGA
Objectives 
--> To build a GPU coprocessor using an FPGA, with certain basic functions like
--> Line drawing
--> Rectangular fill and draw
--> Circle fill and draw

We will be aiming for a single buffered 320x240 resolution drawing mode.
